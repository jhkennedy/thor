 About FEvoR
=============

FEvoR is a statistical fabric evolution model that includes 
recrystallization processes such as:
    Grain Growth
    Polygonization
    Migration Recrstallization

FEvoR is based on the work by Dr. Thorsteinsson, see:
    Thorsteinsson, T. (2001). 
    An analytical approach to deformation of anisotropic ice-cryrstal 
    aggregates. Journal of Glaciology, 47(158), 507–516.

    107(B1,2014), 1–13. doi:10.1029/2001JB000244

FEvoR was devoloped at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) by 
Joseph H Kennedy. For a detailed description of this model, see:

==========================================
 MATLAB PACKAGE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

MATLAB will automatically recognize FEvoR once the +PKG directories 
are added the matlab path. To do this:
       
Add the folder containing this README, Contents.m, and the +PKG directories 
to the matlab path. If these are located at /usr/local/matlab/FEvoR then 
you would add this path to the matlab path by typing at the command prompt:

    >> path(path, '/usr/local/matlab/FEvoR/')

Matlab automatically recognizes directories found on the path using the '+' 
syntax as packages.

       =====================
          USING A PACKAGE
       =====================

        All functions in package +PKG are called in matlab by:

            >> PKG.FUNCTION

        Likewise all functions in the subpackages of +PKG 
        (+PKG/+SUBPACKAGE) are called by:

            >> PKG.SUBPACKAGE.FUNCTION

        and so on and so forth. 

        FEvoR is compliant with MATLABs standard help function. As such, 
        you can see a description, list of functions, and list of 
        subpackages in +PKG by typing:

            >> help PKG

        Likewise you can do the same for a subpackage by typing:

            >> help PKG.SUBPACKAGE

        You can get help on a function by typing:

            >> help PKG.FUNCTION

        or for a function in a subpackage:

            >> help PKG.SUBPACKAGE.FUNCTION

        and so on and so forth. 

==========================================
 OCTAVE PACKAGE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

    Currently FEvoR does not work in octave because octave doesn't 
    use the '+' syntax for packages. There are no plans to make FEvoR 
    octave compliant.
