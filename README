 MATLAB PACKAGE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

MATLAB will automatically recognize this package once the +DIR directories 
are added the matlab path. There are two standard ways of doing this:

    1) Copy the +DIR directories into your user path. You can find this 
       path by typing at the command prompt:

            >> userpath
       
    2) Adding the folder containing the +PKG directories to the matlab 
       path. If +PKGs are located at /usr/local/matlab/packages/+PKG then 
       you would add this path to the matlab path by typing at the command 
       prompt:
            
            >> path(path, '/usr/local/matlab/packages/')
       
       Any further packages copied into this directory using the '+' 
       syntax for MATLAB packages will be automatically recognized by 
       MATLAB. 

       =======================
          USING THE PACKAGE
       =======================

        All functions in package PKG are called in matlab by:

            >> PKG.FUNCTION

        Likewise all functions in subpackages of PKG are called by:

            >> PKG.SUBPACKAGE.FUNCTION

        and so on and so forth. 

        This package is compliant with MATLABs standard help function. 
        As such, you can see a description, list of functions, and list of 
        subpackages in +PKG by typing:

            >> help PKG

        Likewise you can do the same for a subpackage by typing:

            >> help PKG.SUBPACKAGE

        You can get help on a function by typing:

            >> help PKG.FUNCTION

        or for a function in a subpackage:

            >> help PKG.SUBPACKAGE.FUNCTION

        and so on and so forth. 

==========================================
 OCTAVE PACKAGE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

    Currently this package does not work in octave because octave doesn't 
    use the '+' syntax for packages. A fix is in the works.
