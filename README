 MATLAB PACKAGE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

MATLAB will automatically recognize this package once the +Thor directory added
the matlab path. There are two standard ways of doing this:

    1) Coppy the +Thor directory into your user path. You can find this path by 
       typing at the comand prompt

            >> userpath
       
    2) Adding the folder containing the +Thor directory to the matlab path. If 
       +Thor is located at /usr/local/matlab/packages/+Thor then you would add 
       this path to the matlab path by typing at the comand prompt
            
            >> path(path, '/usr/local/matlab/packages/')
       
       Any further packages coppied into this directory using the '+' syntax for
       MATLAB packages will be automatically recognised by MATLAB. 

       =======================
          USING THE PACKAGE
       =======================

        All functions in package Thor are called in matlab by

            >> Thor.FUNCTION

        Likewise all functions in subpackages of Thor are called by

            >> Thor.SUBPACKAGE.FUNCTION

        and so on and so forth. 

        This package is compliant with MATLABs standard help function. As such, 
        you can see a list of funtions and subpackages in Thor by typing

            >> help Thor

        Likewise you can do the same for a subpackage by typing

            >> help Thor.SUBPACKAGE

        You can get help on a function by typing 

            >> help Thor.FUNCTION

        or for a function in a subpackage

            >> help Thor.SUBPACKAGE.FUNCTION

        and so on and so forth.

 OCTAVE PACKAGE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

    Currently this package does not work in octave because octave doesn't use 
    the '+' syntax for packages. A fix is in the works.
