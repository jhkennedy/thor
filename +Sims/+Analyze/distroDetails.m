function [EIG, DISLINFO, SIZEINFO] = distroDetails( cdist , eigenMask)
% [EIG, DISLINFO, SIZEINFO]=distroDetails( cdist, eigenMask) calulates the
% orientation eigenvalues of the crystal distrobution layers defined in
% eigenMask, the min/max/mean dislocation density for each lay, and the
% min/max/mean grain size for each layer. 
%
%   cdist is the structure holding the crystal distrobution outlined in
%   Thor.setup. 
% 
%   eigenMask is a NxM logical array where eigenMask(:,m) is the mth layer
%   in of the crystal distrobution.
%
% eigen returns EIG which is a 3xM array holding the orientation
% eigenvalues for each layer, SIZEINFO which is a 3xM array holding the
% [min, max, mean] grain size for each layer, and DISLINFO which is a 3xM
% array holding the  [min, max, mean] dislocation density for each layer.
%
%   eigen follows the method as outlined in:
%       Gagliardini, O., Durand, G., & Wang, Y. (2004). 
%       Grain area as a statistical weight for polycrystal constituents.
%       Journal of Glaciology, 50(168), 87â€“95.
